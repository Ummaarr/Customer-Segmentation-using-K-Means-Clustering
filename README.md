Project Overview
Customer segmentation helps businesses identify distinct customer groups based on behavioral patterns. This project applies K-Means Clustering to analyze and categorize customers, enabling data-driven decision-making for targeted marketing strategies.

📌 Project Workflow
✅ 1. Data Preprocessing
Load and clean the data using pandas.
Select relevant features for analysis.
✅ 2. Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters
Use the Elbow Method to determine the best number of clusters.
✅ 3. Applying K-Means Clustering
Implement K-Means Algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups.
✅ 4. Data Visualization
Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the customer segments.
🎯 Key Insights from the Analysis
Customers were segmented into different groups based on their spending behavior.
These insights help businesses create personalized marketing strategies.
High-value customers can be targeted with exclusive offers, while budget-conscious customers may benefit from discount campaigns.
